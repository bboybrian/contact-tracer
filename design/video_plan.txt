(Start with one Update: "App Launched","UG117's COVID-19 web app is now up and running")

- User X is an admin and a venue owner, unregistered as of now
    Hi, I'm Zac, administrator of this contact tracing server, and the proud owner of McDonalds
    I'm gonna log in with gmail, to register McDonalds as a location.

- On his PC, X logs in with gmail (1)
- X registers his venue, and sees the map-marker appear (6, 5)
    This marker shows the location that I just registered.
    Not only can users check-in by clicking on the marker, but the color of the marker tells them which locations are hotspots.
    As more people visit a location, the marker turns orange, then red.
    I'm already here at my McDonalds, so I'm gonna go ahead and check-in.

- X checks-in using the map marker (2c)
- From the 'Profile' drop-down, X views and edits the name of his venue (9)
    If I had made a mistake when registering my location, I could fix it easily from here.

- X updates his particulars in the profile page, and scrolls down to see his check-in marker on the map (3, 4b)
    Since I logged in with gmail, my name in the database is currently incorrect
    *edits name* That's better

- X creates a new update, reminding everyone to wash their hands (15)
    As a responsible admin, I can add, edit, or delete updates.

- X edits the update, and deletes the 'App Launched' update (15)
    *edits update* That's better
    *deletes update* Anndd, we don't need this one



- User Y is a friend of X, & currently a regular user
    Hi, I'm Brian, friend of Zac, and a regular user of this contact tracing server
    I haven't actually made an account yet, so I need to sign up

- On his phone, Y signs up & logs in without gmail (1)
- Y checks-in to X's venue using the QR code (2b)
    Now that I have an account, I can finally try out Zac's Mcdonalds
    *scans QR code* I could check-in with the location code, but it's much easier to use a QR scanner

- From the burger menu, Y views his history: 'NOVID-19, no exposures' (16)
    There, I've checked-in, it's in my history
    //omnomnom



- Y has contracted covid-19
    (X:) Guys, we have a problem. Brian has covid-19

- X searches for Y by name (11)
    Although this means that I will have to get tested, I have to be responsible & flag Brian.

- X flags Y (12)
- X makes Y an admin (13)
    Just for demonstration purposes, I'm gonna make him an admin

- X searches for his venue, and it shows the exposure to Y (10)
- X showcases the "Add Exposure" button, in the case where Y forgot to check-in (14)
- On the home screen, X sees the swab-test alert & the new update (7, 8)

- Both X & Y have been confirmed healthy
- Y searches for & unflags X (both flag buttons are visible) (12)
- Y searches for & unflags himself (12)
- Y signs out (1)
